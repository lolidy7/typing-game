Step 5 — Base Game Screen

Prompt to agent:

    Create GameScreen implementing LibGDX’s Screen interface.
    Display the player sprite at bottom-center and draw the HUD with:

        Lives: 5 hearts in top-left

        WPM: dummy number in top-right

        Hit Record: dummy number top-center
        No movement or typing yet — just render the HUD and player.
        Commit as Milestone 3: HUD and player appear.

Step 6 — Enemy Jets and Words

Prompt to agent:

    Create EnemyJet class with position, word, and a method to render itself with its word above it.
    Add a SpawnManager to spawn 4–5 EnemyJet objects at random X positions near the top every 5 seconds.
    For now, enemy jets just float slowly downward.
    Commit as Milestone 4: enemies spawn and move.

Step 7 — Typing Combat

Prompt to agent:

    Create a TypingController that:

        Captures player keyboard input.

        When first typed letter matches an enemy’s current word, lock that enemy as the target.

        Each correct letter fires a bullet towards that enemy and advances the word progress.

        On word completion: remove enemy, increment hit record, and increment a kill counter.

        Every 2 kills: add 1 life (max 5).
        Commit as Milestone 5: basic typing combat works.

Step 8 — Enemy Fire

Prompt to agent:

    Each enemy has a fire timer (5 seconds).
    When the timer triggers, spawn a fireball projectile aimed at the player.
    If a fireball reaches the player, reduce lives by 1.
    When lives reach 0, switch to a Game Over screen.
    Commit as Milestone 6: enemies shoot and player can die.

Step 9 — Difficulty Scaling

Prompt to agent:

    Add scaling so that every 30 seconds or after 20 kills:

        Increase enemy speed.

        Shorten spawn interval.

        Use longer/harder words from medium.txt then hard.txt.
        Commit as Milestone 7: difficulty increases over time.

Step 10 — WPM and Final HUD

Prompt to agent:

    Implement WPM calculation as (completedWords / elapsedSeconds) * 60.
    Display live WPM in HUD.
    Ensure Hit Record shows total enemies destroyed.
    Commit as Milestone 8: WPM & final HUD.

Step 11 — Game Over Screen

Prompt to agent:

    Create a Game Over screen that displays:

        Final WPM

        Final Hit Record

        Total survival time
        Add a “Restart” button that starts a new GameScreen.
        Commit as Milestone 9: Game Over screen complete.

    Step 12 — Polish

    Prompt to agent:

            Add simple explosion effect when enemies die.

            Add sound effects for shooting, enemy hit, and player hit.
        
            Add background with parallax clouds.
        Commit as Milestone 10: polished gameplay.
